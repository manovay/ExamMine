This paragraph \nbegins by saying , \u201cBetween 1890 and 1920, there was notable change in the fact that local political \nreforms and nationwide social reforms both exposed the corruptness of the political atmosphere, using \npropaganda and local campaigns to tackle a nationwide epidemic of polit ical corruption.\u201d  The response \nthen qualifies its argument by stating, \u201cHowever, there is a greater change in the fact that no local and \nsocial reforms could combat the spoils system and big business\u2019 effect on politics. . . . In Doc. 2, \nRoosevelt explains that big corporations need to be controlled and supervised.  Roosevelt\u2019s intended \naudience was big business to warn them of the fact that they cannot keep control of politics forever, and the American people to encourage them to have hope that reform will be made.  Roosevelt further \ndeveloped these ideas when running for the Progressive Bull Moose party in 1912 against Wilson.  \nRoosevelt\u2019s speech shows that the power of big business over politics was so grand that it needed \ncontrol, showing a continuation in their omnipotence in politics despite criticism from progressives.\u201d  \nUltimately, this response demonstrates a complex understanding of how the Progressive movement fostered \npolitical change but also the political and economic forces that ultimately limited this change.  \n\u2022 This response demonstrates a complex understanding of the Progressive Era by qualifying its argument. \u201cLastly, while the progressive movement led to some political achievements in increasing the democracy of voters, it failed to achieve true protection of democratic principles in that Black voters \nwere still limited in terms of their voting rights.  During the progressive movement, many democratic \nideals were seen at the state level.  Most notably was the initiative, referendum, and recall progr ams \nestablished by many state governments."

Question 1  \u2014 Document -Based Question  \nNote: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors.  \nOverview  \n \n\u2022 This question required students to evaluate the impact of the Progressive movement on United States \npolitics from 1890 to 1920. The content expectations of the question originated principally from  \nPeriod 7 of the course framework, focusing on Progressive efforts to regulate the economy, reform \nsociety, and reduce  corruption in United States politics, fostering democracy. Students also were \nexpected to address the problems that emerged or intensified during industrialization, urbanization, and \nimmigration , and/or the reform efforts of the earlier Populist movement.  \n\u2022 The intention of the question was to determine if students could defensibly evaluate the extent to which \nthe Progressives improved conditions in the United States and consider the areas in which the movement \nfell short in improving conditions, most frequently by addressing the limits of Progressivism in \nimproving conditions for African Americans and improving race relations. The question allowed for \nflexibility in approach ."

A few documents also invited the students to consider all of the Progressive amendments (the 16\nth through the 19th). \n\u2022 This question primarily focused on continuity and change,  causation , contextualization, analyzing \nprimary sources, and argument development.  \n\u2022 This question mainly addressed Key Concept 7.1.  \nSample: 1A  \nScore:  7 \n A. Thesis/Claim (0 \u20131 points): 1  \nThe response earned 1 point for the thesis. The thesis is located in the last three sentences of the introduction : \n\u201cDue to the shrewd politics of the Gilded Age, the progressive era, which lasted from 1890 \u2019s through 1920s \nseemed to foster major political change because it incr eased the power and influence of the federal government \nas well as further democratized state governments. Economically, change includes government political involvement in businesses. Socially, change includes political governmental involvement in tempera nce, \nabolition, and food.\u201d  \n \nB. Contextualization (0 \u20131 points): 1  \nThe response earned 1 point for contextualization. In the first paragraph, the response describes the broader \nhistorical context of the industrial period. The response provides a well -develop ed understanding of the historical \ndevelopments that occurred before the Progressive Era ( e.g., \u201claissez faire policies,\u201d the \u201clack of involvement, by \nboth the federal and state governments,\u201d and \u201c captains of industry/ robber barons\u201d)."

In the second paragraph, the response uses Documents 2 and 4 to support the argument that the \nlack of government regulation led to reforms at the federal and state level. The response uses Document 2 to \nargue that  reforms by the federal government regulate d railroads and shifted  public attitudes toward trusts.  It \nuses Document 4  to support  an argument that governments became \u201cm ore democratic in their approach to \npassing bills and laws.\u201d In the third paragraph, the response uses Documents 7 and 1 to support an argument \nabout social reforms. The response uses Document 7 to support an argument that the government became more libera l by supporting Prohibition and women\u2019s suffrage. Document 1 is used to support the reform of city \ncorruption by political bosses. In the same paragraph, Documents 3 and 6 are used to support an argument that state and local governments were also  influenced by the Progressive movement .  \n Evidence Beyond the Documents  \n \nThe response earned 1 point for using at least one additional piece of specific historical evidence that relates to an argument about the prompt . The response provides a large amount  of well -described outside evidence."

Analysis and Reasoning (0 \u20132 points): 2  \nDocument Sourcing  \n \nThe response earned 1 point for explaining the relevance of sourcing to the argument for at least three \ndocuments. The response primarily uses historical situation to explain the relevance of the documents to an \nargument. For Document 2  the response  explains that Roosevelt believed in th e concept of \u201c \u2018good and bad \ntrusts. \u2019\u201d For Document 4 the response correctly connects ideas of the Wisconsin Plan to the reforms in California. \nFor Document 5 the response explains that the role of \u201cwhite -middle  class women\u201d contributed to the lack of \nreforms for Native Americans and African Americans and resegregation in the federal government under Wilson.  \nAnd for Document 7, the response argues that  the activism depicted by the image was a part of advocacy for the \n18\nth Amendment .   \n \nDemonstrating Complex Understanding  \nThe response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding of the historical development that is the \nfocus of the prompt. Complex understanding is demonstrated throughout the entire response and in a variety of \nways. Corroboration is achieved through the analysis of  multiple variables such as the reforms at federal and \nstate levels. In the last paragraph, the response qualifies the argument with a strong discussion contrasting the \nexploitation and suppression of self- determination of people in other countries with reform  for some Americans at \nhome. Overall, this response demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the historical processes of the \nProgressive Era."

Question 3  \u2014 Long Essay Question  \nNote: Student samples are quoted verbatim and may contain spelling and grammatical errors.  \nOverview  \n \n\u2022 This question asked students to evaluate the extent  to which debates over slavery in the period from 1830 \nto 1860 led the United States into the Civil War.  In general, students began with the Missouri \nCompromise (establishing contextualization) and then continued with other events such as the \nNullification  Crisis, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas\u2013 Nebraska Act. Few students extended their \ncontextualization scope into the Civil War and Reconstruction periods.  \n\u2022 In part, responses were expected to demonstrate an ability to evaluate the many variables relat ed to the \nonset of the Civil War . \n\u2022 Responses were expected to demonstrate use of contextualization and argument development . Further, \nresponses were expected to utilize causation, comparison, or continuity and change to frame or structure \nan argument that a ddresse d the prompt.  \n\u2022 This question mainly addressed Key Concept 5. 2. \nSample: 3A \nScore: 6  \n \nA. Thesis/Claim (0 \u20131 points): 1  \n \nThis response earned 1 point for the thesis."

This response provides a plethora of contextual information \nfrom before the time period of the prompt. This contextual material includes a relevant reference to the \nConstitution, for example, by stating  that it \u201cnever fully addressed the issue of enslavement for African \nAmericans.\u201d It also accurately identifies the Missouri Compromise as a \u201ctemporary solution\u201d to balancing  \nlegislative power in Congress.   \n C. Evidence (0 \u20132 points): 2  \n \nThe second and third paragraphs provide multiple pieces of evidence, including John Calhoun, the Wilmot \nProviso, Manifest Destiny, and the Compromise of 1850. These examples are relevant to the topic and earned      \n1 point for use of evidence. The e xplanation of the evidence supports the overall thesis , so the response  earned \nthe second point for evidence . It argues, for example, that the Compromise of 1850 failed to resolve the very \nconflict it attempted to address as \u201cthe North & the South could not agree on a solution & constant aggravation \nled to a Civil War. \u201d  \n  \nAP\u00ae UNITED STATES HISTORY  \n2019  SCORING COMMENTARY  \n\u00a9 2019  The College Board.  \nVisit the College Board on the w eb: collegeboard.org.

However, this argument is not developed enough to demonst rate a complex understanding of the period. Later \nthe response does demonstrate a complex understanding of the development of the period by corroborating its argument across multiple themes , and it earned the point for complexity . It demonstrates differenc es between \nNorth and South along political and economic lines. It further corroborates this argument across time periods and other regions in the conclusion when it uses the evidence of Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address and a shift in \u201cthe \nfocus of the war from  unification to emancipation\u201d to argue that the South became divided , not jus t from the \nNorth but also from G reat Britain and that these divides continued after 1860.

The response uses content from \nDocuments 3, 4, and 5 to corroborate this claim , and it also weaves in evidence beyond the documents \nabout muckraking and W. E. B. DuBois to further support this sophisticated argument. This paragraph \nbegins by saying , \u201cBetween 1890 and 1920, there was notable change in the fact that local political \nreforms and nationwide social reforms both exposed the corruptness of the political atmosphere, using propaganda and local campaigns to tackle a nationwide epidemic of polit ical corruption.\u201d The response \nthen qualifies its argument by stating, \u201cHowever, there is a greater change in the fact that no local and \nsocial reforms could combat the spoils system and big business\u2019 effect on politics. . . . In Doc. 2, \nRoosevelt explains that big corporations need to be controlled and supervised. Roosevelt\u2019s intended \naudience was big business to warn them of the fact that they cannot keep control of politics forever, and the American people to encourage them to have hope that reform will be made. Roosevelt further \ndeveloped these ideas when running for the Progressive Bull Moose party in 1912 against Wilson. Roosevelt\u2019s speech shows that the power of big business over politics was so grand that it needed \ncontrol, showing a continuation in their omnipotence in politics despite criticism from progressives.\u201d \nUltimately, this response demonstrates a complex understanding of how the Progressive movement fostered \npolitical change but also the political and economic forces that ultimately limited this change."

It addresses the \nMexican-American War, the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas \u2013Nebraska Act, and the Lincoln\u2013 Douglas \ndebates to support a nuanced argument. This consideration of alternative views demonstrates a complex \nunderstanding of historical developments from 1830 to 1860. \u201cIn essence, rather than the debates over \nslavery being the main cause of the Civil War, the main cause was that the North and South were \nalready divided and slavery is just the result.\u201d \n\u2022 The following essay argues that the differences in ideals and sectional interests, and the inability to \ncompromise during this period , culminated in an irreversible divide. It identifies the reasons f or \nsectionalism and for the change in the Northern goals in the Civil War , from preserv ing the Union to ending \nslavery. This corroborates the initial argument by demonstrating a causation relation, proving the thesis."

This would be crucial, as the South would lose support from Britain & Europe as they did not \nwant to support an immoral cause. Overall, the difference in ideals, sectional interests & inability to \ncompromise during this period culminated in an irreversible divide between North & South and our \nnation\u2019s only Civil War. \u201d \nExample of unacceptable demons tration of a complex understanding : \n\u2022 The following response does not demonstrate a complex understanding. It attempts unsuccessfully to link \nseveral events across time periods on a theme of inequality. Ultimately, the chronological confusion and \nlack of rel evant elaboration fail to make the connection . \u201cIn the case Plessy vs Ferguson , it was upheld \nthat segregation was constitutional, which only added to heinous government decisions like the Three Fifths compromise, which only counted every 3 out of 5 slaves as human beings. This inequality \nangered many people, as they argued that every man is equal, as demonstrated in the Declaration of \nIndependence. The neglect of egalitarianism seemed unconstitutional, but no one with government \npower bothered to make any changes.\u201d \n\u00a9 2019 The College Board. \nVisit the College Board on the web: collegeboard.org."

The most frequent historical development to contrast with this economic affluence was \ncontinued discrimination against minority groups. The question allowed for flexibility in approach. \nResponses could address the role the federal government played in economic development, the impact of new technologies on Americans\u2019 lives, the Civil Rights movement, the growth of suburbanization and affluence, and the resulting effects of these developments. Responses could also take a \nchronological approach by discussing the end of the Second World War and its impact on the economy; the suburbanization of white, middle class Americans; the beginnings of the Civil Rights \nmovement; and the white flight from United States cities throughout the 1960s. \n\u2022\t The documents encouraged students to discuss issues of governmental support of a postwar economy, the increase of consumerism, the growth of the middle class in the suburbs, the maintenance of typical \ngender roles, technological innovation, and the disparity between white and non-white populations. \n\u2022\t This question primarily focused on continuity and change, contextualization, analyzing primary sources, and argument development. \n\u2022\t This question primarily addressed Topics 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.10. \nSample: 1A \nThesis/Claim: 1  \nContextualization: 1 \nEvidence:  3  \nAnalysis and Reasoning: 2 \nTotal Score: 7 \nA.

Generally, responses used the Second Great Awakening, \nestablishing contextualization and then identified specific social issues, such as abolition, women\u2019s \nrights, and temperance, to build their arguments."

Specifically, students could connect the impact of the market revolution on society and culture (covered in Topic 4.6) and the development of an American culture focused on the ideal of perfectibility (covered in Topic 4.9) to how these developments contributed to the Age of Reform. The responses could also have placed the causal relationship in the context of the ideals of the founding of the United States, including Enlightenment \nconcepts, propelled by the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening. \nSample: 3A \nThesis/Claim: 1  \nContextualization: 1 \nEvide nce:  2  \nAnalysis and Reasoning: 2 \nTota l Score:  6 \nA.

It qualifies the argument by \nconsidering and then rejecting an alternate view that the lack of United States participation in the League of Nations signified a return to isolationism. The response ultimately concludes that those actions did not \nnegate the growing role of the United States in global affairs. \nSample: 4B \nThesis/Claim: 1  \nContextualization: 1 \nEvidence:  1 \nAnalysis and Reasoning: 1 \nTotal Score:  4 \nA.   Thesis/Claim  (0\u20131  points): 1  \nThe response earned 1 point for thesis/claim. It makes a historically defensible claim in the introduction that international conflicts led the United States to additional involvement in world affairs with minimal change in \nits trade policies. \nB.   Contextualization  (0\u20131  points):  1  \nThe response earned 1 point for contextualization. It describes the broader historical context of American industrialization as a motivation for additional trade with Europe and countries in the Pacific Ocean. \nC.   Evide nce  (0\u20132  points):  1 \nThe response earned 1 point in this category for providing specific examples of relevant evidence. Examples include details about the entry of the United States into the First World War and about postwar economic \nstruggles that contributed to the Great Depression. The response did not earn the second point for using \nevidence. The response does not support an argument using two specific and relevant examples."

The first, by Kenneth Stampp, argued that Reconstruction, \ndespite some failures, had an overall positive impact due to the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The second, by Eric Foner, argued that Reconstruction was a total failure, resulting in the pervasive expansion of racism. \n\u2022\t Responses had to provide relevant evidence (1863\u20131900) and explain how it supported each of the arguments found in the excerpts. \n\u2022\t Students had to understand the fundamental differences between the two authors\u2019 views, use evidence to de monstrate how conditions improved for formerly enslaved people as a result of Reconstruction to \nsupport Stampp\u2019s view, and then use evidence to show how conditions worsened to support Foner\u2019s view. \n\u2022\t This question focused on analyzing historical evidence and secondary sources. \n\u2022\t This question primarily addressed Topics 5.10 and 5.11."

The first, by Kenneth Stampp, argued that Reconstruction, despite some failures, had an overall positive impact due to the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The second, by \nEric Foner, argued that Reconstruction was a total failure, resulting in the pervasive expansion of racism."

The content tests Period 8 of the course framework, focusing both on government efforts \nto encourage economic growth, as well as the social effects of an expanding economy and technological \ninnovations. \n\u2022 The intention of the question was to determine if students could defensibly evaluate the extent to which economic expansion transformed the lives of Americans but also limited opportunities for others. The most frequent \nhistorical development to contrast with this economic affluence was continued discrimination against minority groups. The question allowed for flexibility in approach. Responses could address the role the federal \ngovernment played in economic development, the impact of new technologies on Americans\u2019 lives, the Civil \nRights movement, the growth of suburbanization and affluence, and the resulting effects of these developments. \nResponses could also take a chronological approach by discussing the end of the Second World War and its impact on the economy; the suburbanization of White, middle class Americans; the beginnings of the Civil Rights \nmovement; and the White flight from American cities throughout the 1960s. \n\u2022 The documents encouraged students to discuss issues of governmental support of a postwar economy, the increase of consumerism, the growth of the middle class in the suburbs, the maintenance of typical gender \nroles, technological innovation and the disparity between White and non-White populations. \n\u2022 This question primarily focused on continuity and change, contextualization, analyzing primary sources, and \nargument development. \n\u2022 This question primarily addressed Topics 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.10."

Points: 6  Topic:  Reform Movements in the 19th  Century  \nMean Score: 1.80  \nWhat were the responses to this question expected to demonstrate? \n\u2022 The question prompt asked students to evaluate the relative importance of causes of reform activity in the United \nStates in the period from 1800 to 1848. Generally, responses used the Second Great Awakening, establishing \ncontextualization and then identified specific social issues, such as abolition, women\u2019s rights, and temperance, to \nbuild their arguments. The responses were expected to evaluate the causal relationship between societal factors \nand the reform movements spurred by them, in the context of perfectionism driven by the combination of \nEnlightenment rationalism and religious zeal. \n\u2022 The responses were expected to demonstrate an ability to weigh the relative importance of reform causes and connect this analysis to the development of reform from 1800 to 1848. \n\u2022 The historical reasoning process of causation was given in the prompt. \n\u2022 This question primarily addressed Topics 4.10 and 4.11. Specifically, students could connect the impact of the \nmarket revolution on society and culture (covered in Topic 4.6) and the development of an American culture \nfocused on the ideal of perfectibility (covered in Topic 4.9) to how these developments contributed to the Age \nof Reform. The responses could also have placed the causal relationship in the context of the ideals of the \nfounding of the United States, including Enlightenment concepts, propelled by the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening. \nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question?"

Many students confused the reforms of the Gilded Age/Progressive Era with the antebellum reforms or weaved them together. The most \ncommon reforms students discussed correctly in the time period were the abolition of slavery, women\u2019s suffrage/rights, and temperance. Many students did bring in prison and mental health reform using Dorothea Dix and educational reform using Horace Mann successfully. \n\u2022 For the thesis/claim point responses, many students struggled to differentiate between cause and effect and focused on the effects of antebellum reforms rather than the causes instigating these reforms. The prompt \nlanguage of evaluating relative importance of causes was largely ignored by students, and if it was attempted, it many times distracted or convoluted their arguments. \n\u2022 For the contextualization point, responses exhibited some element of understanding reform, but they struggled with chronology and were not able to appropriately contextualize the time period or events. The Gilded Age and Progressive reforms were most conflated with the antebellum reforms. Students often struggled to \nseparate the two eras. Additionally, many students attributed political activity to reform, such as attributing political compromise as reform measures. Very few students effectively made a reform case for political \nactions. Few responses mentioned the Market Revolution or explained how it caused social and cultural reform. This is concerning considering it is one of the Key Concepts for this question. More responses used the Second Great Awakening as a cause for reforms but failed to connect it to the ideal of perfectibility and the \nreasoning behind the reforms. \n\u2022 Students were strongest in the discussions of enslavement and women\u2019s rights."

Students struggled with distinguishing between \ncause of reform and effect of reform.

For example, many attributed temperance as the cause for \nreform of alcohol consumption and the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment as the effect."

The first excerpt by Ray Billington argues that westward expansion was established by skilled farmers that had knowledge to manage the land that few people possessed. He also indicates \nthat while there were many heroic figures as part of westward migration, the true hero was the farmer. The second excerpt by Carlos Schwantes claims the expansion of westward migration was influenced by wage workers who were connected to markets outside of the West. \n\u2022 Students had to understand the fundamental differences between the two authors\u2019 arguments, use evidence not found in the excerpt to demonstrate Billington\u2019s argument, and then use \nevidence not found in the excerpt to demonstrate Schwantes\u2019s argument. \n\u2022 Responses had to provide and explain relevant evidence (between 1848\u20131898) that supported each author\u2019s argument. \n\u2022 This question focused on analyzing historical evidence and secondary sources. \n\u2022 This question primarily addressed Topics 5.2, 6.2, and 6.3. \nSample Identifier: 1A \nScore:  3  \nThe response to part (a) earned 1 point by briefly describing the contrast between Billington\u2019s and \nSchwantes\u2019s claim about farmers and wageworkers."

The first excerpt by \nRay Billington argues that westward expansion was established by skilled farmers that had knowledge to manage the land that few people possessed. He also indicates that while there were many heroic figures as part of westward migration, the true hero was the farmer. The second excerpt by Carlos Schwantes claims the expansion of westward migration was influenced by wage workers who were \nconnected to markets outside of the West."

Economic motivations \nfor migration included the Great Depression, post-World War II affluence, defense contracting, the G.I.

However, the preponderance of the contextualization attempts focused \non World I, World War II, and the Great Depression. Often, these responses continued with an \nexplanation of how these events caused internal migration, so the explanation of the broader \nhistorical event was awarded points for evidence supporting an argument instead of \ncontextualization."

        "chunk_text": "Commercial development from 1800 to 1855 changed the way in which slave labor was viewed in society \nin the south, as people began to capitalize on the buying and selling of slave.  Yet, in the north, commercial \ndevelopment had the effect of widening labor practices in factories, fostering unsafe and unhealthy working \nconditions for laborers.  \n    In the agrarian south, the economy depended on the free labor of African slaves.  As the regio n was developing \ncommercially, people began to realize the profits that could be made through the sale of slaves in the south as the \nneed for them grew.  Document 3 expresses a letter asking to make a deal in terms of selling slaves.  The motive for \nthis d eal would be the profits that could be enjoyed after the sale.  The selling of slaves was a quick way to make a \nbig fortune since so many big plantations in the south relied on them for free labor.  This document shares how due \nto the common and now commercial practice of slavery, people were capitalizing on their chances to make a profit \nby selling a human being, widening the practice even more in the south.  Document 5 shows the contrast to how \nAfrican Americans lived in the north and south.  In the north, they enjoyed a lot more freedom where they were \nactually able to exercise their rights as human beings, athering in parlors, and playing music, etc.  Even though they \nare being treated badly in the north by white people, the commercial practice of slaver y in the south made it near \nimpossible for African Amercians to enjoy the same rights in the south as thye do in the north.  The \ncommercialization around slavery in the south led to so much tensions between the north and south.  Especially with \nthe land ga ined in America after the Mexican American War, the institution of slavery  was able to expand like it \nnever had before."

        "chunk_text": "This allowed for now people to settle west, bringing their slaves with them, further expanding the \ncommercial desire for slavery since people were able to easily see how slave labor was a cheap and easy way to \ngrow a fortune.  However, in Document 7, by Frederick Douglass, a famous African American abolitionist figure \nduring this time brought up the idea that if more laborers vote for pr oslavery candidates, then the practice of slavery \nwill continue to expand in the south.  With the expansion of slavery, laborers would be paid less and soon be treated \nlike slaves for their work.  This document shows how due to commercial development of slavery, especially in the \nsouth, people would find it as common practice to treat laborers the same way.  If planters in the south were able to \nmake such a profit off of slave labor, factory owners might begin to see the benefit of treated their workers the  same \nway.  \n    The effects of commercial development also led to societal changes in the north due to increased industrial \nproduction of goods and need for cheap labor.  Due to the Market Revolution, industrialized businesses began to \ngrow and more efficient processes of production were introduced.  Yet, this commercial development came with the \nnegative treatment of factory workers, specifically women and children.  In Document 4, the truth about how \nchildren are treated and denied the space to grow is bro ugh to light.  Elias Nason believes children need to have the \nopportunity to grow and enrich their minds during this critical stage in developmet.  Nason was studying to become \na minister.  During this era, the Second Great Awakening occured, spreading the  ideals of religous reforms in the \nforms of abolition, reforms in child labor, and so much more."

Document 1 also includes religious authors sharing their \nideas on labor in American society.  Yet, in this document, the author is advocating for temperance with laborers in \norder for them  to grow and succeed in society.  Here the ideals of the Second Great Awakening are being displayed \nonce again, in the hopes of creating a model society, which included the issues with how laborers are treated.  \nCommerical development put a lot of spotlight on laborers, especially in the north, causing their actions and \ntreatment to cause a lot of contraversy in Amecian society.  For exapmple, where some may see the cheap and \nunsafe labor of women in factories, some women themselves see the benefits rather than the drawbacks to doing that \nwork.  Document 6 comes from a woman who actually works in these kinds of facotires and has the firsthand \nexpericnce needed to make these kinds of accounts.  She explains how women are given the opportunity of \neducation at night school and make their own wages on their own time.  Where the commercial development in \nAmerican society led to extremely poor conditions of work for laborers, it also provided women the opportunity of \neconomic dependednce and advancements in educati on.  It gave some of them a role outside of the home, even if \nthat place was dangerous.  \n    Commercial development between 1800 and 1855 greatly changed US society, but had different effects on \ndifferent regions.  In the south, commercial development widened the practice of slavery and people began to view \nPage 1 of 2\n1A\nslavery as a necessity for economic development."

While some may claim that commerical development did not change American \nsociety unti the gilded age, Commercial devlopment played a big role in changing United States society from 1800 -\n1855 as it created factories which soon became a staple of American society, it revamped the demand for slave labor \nas a result of new efficient inventions, and brought back concerns of slavery, and it improved the conditions of \nAfrican Americans in north.   \n    In the periods  1800- 1855 there were many things changing in America. Factories started to pop up and slavery \nbecame a real issue that dived most Americans. So much that Senatory Summner was involved in an altercation over slavery in the UNited STates Senate. Slavery had  such an effect on the United States that U.S. Senators were \ninvolved in fights regarding it. Factories started to change American society in many ways, as the country was no \nlonger only involved manily in agriculture. American workers rights were also a big issue, many factories were \nputting their workers under horribe conditions, with little wages, long hours, and even employing children.   \n     First, as American was undergoing industrial revolutions, factories were popping up in America. American \nstarted  to go from a country thats only producer was agriculutere, to a country which also had factories producing \nmanufactered goods. Soon thousands of people would be transformed into citizens working in factotries (document \n4)."

Futhermore, there were \nalso numerous benefits that were attractive to factory work ers such as lectures, libraries, and evenigng schools \n(Document 6). The purpose of Americans bragging about factory life was to show just how well it had become a staple in soceity and that they had accepted it. Those benefits made more come into factory l ife which futher \ntrandfotemed America into a country of commerical devleopment and factories. All in all the creation of factories \ntruly changed American society and marked the transiiton from only agriculture to including factory production as a \nmajor pro ducer from America.  \n     Second, the commerical devlopment also revamped the need for slave labor, and as a result brought back strong \nfeelings about slavery. The creation of the steam engine allowed for the south to transport much cotton to all across the country as railroards became devleopmed. The north became a major customer of the southern cotton. The \ncreation of the steam engine allowed for more cotton to be shipped to the north and in less time (document 2). This \nchanged American soceity because as slavery became revamped, discontent with slavery also was revamped. Eli \nWhitney created the Cotton Gin, which made harvesting cotton much quicker and efficient, which effectivaly revamped slavery. Whitney's invention was quickly spread across the South as slavery was beginning to die dow, \nbut his invention made sure slavery was revamped. Soon, Americans began buying and selling slaves at even more faster rates than they had initially (document 3). Plantation owners wanted to make money, as a result they wer e so \neager to buy slaves.  Soon, the north began to voice their opposistion towards the slave labor."

Ultimately, commerical devleopment such as the steam engine and El i Whitney's inevntion increased the demand for slave labor and transformed America back into a \nsociety of cocern over race.   \n     Lastly, the commercial development such as the creation of facotories signifcalty improved the African \nAmericans' condition. I n the north, the race as a whole was liked, and many African Americans were able to make it \nin the north and have a comfortabel life with houses of nice things such as sofas, mirrors, and other nice amenitites (Document 5). THe creation of facotires prompt ed the African Americans to travle to the north and get jobs where \nthey would be able to earn a living. Many freed slaves escaped the south and went to the north to seek refuge. Those \nfreed slaves were able to speak their truth and publish news papers and articles detailing the plight of African \nAmericans and giving ideas on how to stop slavery (Document 7). Frederick Douglass' articles were aimed at white Americans in an aim to appeal to their logic as he details how voting for individuals who support slavery hurts the \nwhite man; all to stop slavery and improve the African American condition. Ultimately, the creation of factories \nprompted African Americans to migrate north looking for jobs and some recieved jobs and earned a lvinig with improved their race' s condition.  \n     However, some may argue that the commerical development had little to no impact on the changing soceity of \nAmerica from 1800 -1855 and that Americans just wanted to make money from slaves and alway wanted slave labor, \nthe conditions of sla ves improved because Ameircans grew a conscioence."

The content tests Period s 5, 6, and parts of 7 of the \ncourse framework, focusing on the expanding definition of who was a citizen within the \nboundaries of the United States and the expanding inclusion of territories t o the United States. \nThe question also required an understanding of social issues involving race, gender, and \nimmigration.  \n\u2022 The intention of the question was to determine if students could defensibly evaluate the extent to which the definition of American citizenship was growing and whether the pursuit of \nequality was a part of American national identity. The most frequent historical development to \ncontrast with this growing definition of citizenship was continued discrimination against \nAfrican Americans, N ative Americans, women, and immigrants. The question allowed for \nflexibility in approach. Responses could address the role government played in expanding \ncitizenship. They could also then address the societal issues surrounding African Americans, \nNative Am ericans, women, inhabitants of acquired territories, and immigrants.  \n\u2022 This question primarily focused on continuity and change, contextualization, analyzing primary \nsources, and argument development.  \n\u2022 This question primarily addressed Topics 5.10 -11, 6.2- 3, 6.8-9, and 7.2 -3.  \nSample:  1A \nThesis /Claim : 1 \nContextualization: 1  \nEvidence: 3  \nAnalysis and Reasoning: 2  \n \nTotal Score: 7  \n \nA."

Although it furthered the British North American colonies' ties to England, transatlantic \ntrade succeeded in drastically changing the British North American colonial society to large extent by leading to the \ndevelopment of distinct regions throughout the colonies and leading to the dependence of Southern society on slave labor.  \n       To begin with, the transatlantic trade involved many of the British North American colonies, but, at each port, \ndifferent items were exchanged, leading to the development of distinct economical regi ons between these colonies; \nthese unique economies, in turn, shaped British American colonial society."

        "chunk_text": "For example, the Massachussetts Bay Colony in the northern region had originally been founded on the principle of religious tolerance (for select religio ns \nexcluding Catholicism and Judaism). Located along the coast, this colony quickly became apart of transatlantic \ntrade, which led to the formation of the colony's economy. The economy of the Massachussetts Bay Colony became \nbased around fishing, but, more  importantly, shipbuilding, as a merchant class evolved within this economy and \nsought to partake in the transatlantic trade. As a result, this colony was more reliant on commerce than agriculture, \nleading to tightly spaced and closer knit communities, all owing these societies to become more connected and \nreliant on the church. In the South, the colony of Virginia was originally founded upon the principles of \"God, Gold, \nand Glory\". However, after harsh seasons and the discovery of the absence of gold, the colonists grew discontent. \nBut, the transatlantic slave trade gradually increased the wealth of Virginian colonists by encouraging these colonists to grow and trade crops, such as tobacco, a cash crop, in the profitable transatlantic trade. As a result, the Virginian economy became reliant on agriculture, a lot of land was dedicated to farming, and societies became more spread out and less tightly knit than Northern colonies.  \n       In addition to creating distinct regions, the transatlantic trade introduce d Southern colonies to slave labor and \ngradually increased these colonies' dependence on slave labor over time. For example, in 1607, the first Africans \narrived in Virginia, but it was a very small amount. More importantly, these Africans arrived as indent ured servants, \nwith freedom promised to them after a designated number of years of service."

        "chunk_text": "owever, the development of the \ntransatlantic trade made the South reliant on slaves not only by demanding more and more agricultural output from \nthe South, but als o by supplying the South with the slaves through the transatlantic slave trade. In the transatlantic \nslave trade, Europeans in Africa would kidnap Africans or bribe African tribes to kidnap rival tribe members put on ships destined for British North America. Once these ships reached the South, the slaves were auctioned off. The \nincrease of slave labor in the South also led the creation of Southern plantations, a unique characteristic of Southern society that represented the South even after the transatlantic slave trade ended (this is evident in media such as Gone with the Wind).  \n       While the transatlantic trade may have created regions and developed slavery, it did act as a continuity in \nfurthering the British North American colonies' ties with England.  As a crucial part of transatlantic trade, the \ncolonies sold much of their raw materials to consumers in England. The profits from this trade constituted a large part of the colonial economy and made the colonies dependent on England. For example, when the  colonists were \nangry at the Tea Act, which gave the British East India Company a monopoly over the tea trade, colonists rebelled \nthrough the Boston Tea Party, in which vast amounts of expensive of tea were dumped into the Boston Harbor. The \ncolonists reta liated in this way because they were angry that England had the ability to grant monopoly rights to the \nBritish East India Company but they also acknowledged that by ruining the tea, they were harming the crucial \neconomic tie between the colonies in Englan d."

The British, however, was \nthe the main powera as thir navy was the storngest amongst any of his other opponents, and had the wealth and \nresoures to be able to take the area of land East of North Am erica to form its colonies. They had established the city \nof Jamestown, the first permanent colonial settlement, and were able to expand with the ability of their large military power to form a total of 13 colonies connectign each other through the Atlantic Ocean. From the period of 1607 to 1776, the growth of the transatlantic slave trade changed British North American colonial society as it started to \nbring an exahnge of large amoutns of goods and reosurces while also prioriting the idea of mercantilism in the \ncolonies. However, the trade had also establsihed the use of slavery in the predominant Southern colonies whose effect would last for years to come even after American independcne.  \nThe transatlatic slave trade had establsihed a network of network of exchange of resources, however heavily implented the idea of self -profit through mercantilism. Resoruces such as tomatoes, corn, and, and turkey was \nintrodued to the British society while bringing resoruces such as potatoes and horses to the colonies.

It then \nqualifies the argument about change with evidence of continuity, \nnoting that warfare was used to take  land from Native Americans  \nfrom the 17th  century through the 19 th century.   \n\u2022 The response  argues that changes in foreign policy  played a minor  role \nin the growth of the United State s. The response modifies the \nargument by contending that i t was the actions of citizens that \nprimarily contributed to growth, providing evidence like  settlers \npushing into Indigenous land.  \nAdditional Notes : \nThis demonstration of complex understanding must be part of the argument, not merely a phrase or reference.   \n \n  \nFrom even before the Revolution, Americans wanted to spread west. This idea of Manifest Destiny had always \nexisted in the American heart and mind. After the American revolution and the Proclamation of 1763 no longer \napplied, of which colonists ignored, many more Americans went to western territories. This expansion eventually lead them to run into other countries like Spanish Mexico and British Canada. Despite the annexation of Texas and \nmuch of the Southwestern United States, American foreign policy contributed very little to territorial growth from \n1840 to 1898.   \nThe Annexation of Texas was not an act of foreign policy, but rather an act of the people calling upon Manifest Destiny, and the government response to it. Let me explain, people started moving to Texas after the Mexican \ngovernment allowed American citizens to settle there under a few conditions."

        "chunk_text": "Many of these Americans ignored \nthese conditions and settled there anyway, and eventually these Americans mad e a majority within the territory and \ndecided they didn't want to be apart of Mexico anymore so they fought back. The Americans living there then wanted to be a part of the United States, but they weren't annexed for a time because of United States domesti c \npolicy, namely the Missouri Compromise. Although the United States did eventually go to war with mexico and a lot of territory, it wasn't an act of a change in foreign policy but rather the government reacting to the actions of the people that lead to the United States gaining territories like Texas, California, and New Mexico.   \nThe Spanish American War was justified by acting upon the Monroe Doctrine, a piece of United States Foreign policy, but it was largely caused by the actions and pressures by the people not foreign policy. In Spanish Cuba, the Spanish were oppressing upon the Native Cubans that lived there, and Yellow Journalism encouraged many \nAmericans that we needed to do something about it, based on moral grounds. The Navy at this time had also been \nexpanding as a result of Alfred Thayer Mahans book, \"The Influence of the Sea upon History\", which talked of \nexpanding the navy to have a greater presence and impact upon history, which Americans wanted. Because of this \nincreased military power, we felt compelled to use it, which later President Eisenhower warned about in his farewell \naddress. Eventually these two factors combined when the USS Maine blew up in a Cuban Harbor, which the Yellow Journalists blamed the Spanish and called for war, although later investigations revealed that it had been an \naccidental internal explosion and wasn't related to the Spanish at all."

Additionally, Manifest Destiny in the the U.S and its action in part due to it by expanding westward and creating the Trail of Tears to remove native americans from desired land, had influenced an \nemergence to expand in territory. By the 1820s and foward, America had quickly set its goal on expanding in order \nto dominate the western hemisphere and to play a larger part in its country. Despite many arguing that foreign relatios had a low role in the territorial growth of the United States in the later half of the 1800s, foreign policy \nultimately regarded the most influencial in the development of expansion of territory in the United States as a result \nof war with countries, annexations, and buyings off on foreign territories.  \nF\noreign policy ultimately had the largest role in America's territorial growth due to wars that America fought in. By \nthe 1930s, America had the desire to move westward as a result of manifest destiny and its 'god given power' that \nwas rewarded to them. Therefore, America desired to take Texas, Oregon, Arizona, and many other west regions, \nhowever, it could not due to the region being occupied and owned by Mexico."

        "chunk_text": "As a result, the United States interacted wit h war with Mexico, ultimately transforming into the Mexican American War. However, it soon \nbecame destructive for Mexican forces, Mexico surrendered and with the Treaty of Hildago, indicating the northern regions of Mexico were given up to become part of t he United States. As a result, the foreign policy of the United \nStates heavily influenced growth in territory due to the introduction of new land seen in the Mexican- American War.  \nA\nnother reason for foreign policy being the greatest factor in bringing i n territorial growth was due to annexations \nand buyings of land. For instance, in the late 19th century, America had begun its imperialistic acts in order to \ninfluence its growing markets and was seeking to sell to great populations of consumers. However, the United States \nfirst needed to grow its goods in order to sell. As a result, when the Dole company found Hawaii, a foreign territory, \nto be the best place to grow its pineapple agriculture, it requested for the U.S to aquire the land. During the late \n1800s, America focuesed heavily on businesses and granted the Dole company the land by removing the Hawaiian \nmonarchy. Therefore, with the account of annexing Hawaii and removing their monarchy for the countries and \ncompanies' benefits, the U.S was able to g row in size and expanded in territory from foreign land.   \nA\nnother reason for foreign policy being the largest role in territory growth was due to the purchase of land. As the \nUnited States moved westward and Imperialism in America was on the rise, the de sire for further expansion and \ngreater western influence continued. Therefore, when looking into areas to expand, the U.S looked North to the region that was held by Russia, which would soon become Alasaka. As a result, America had purchased Alaska \nfrom Ru ssia and quickly expanded in territory."

This is shown through historical developments in the time period of 1776 -1898 and \nafter as well.  \n    One Historica l Event is that of the Mexican -American war. The Mexican -American war only started due to a \nforeign policy allowing Americans to enter Texas, and with them came slavery, and Texas wanting to be free. All \nthis tension due to foreign policy lead to the Alamo (\"Remember the Alamo\") and united states declaring war on \nMexico. After the United States won the war and signed a peace treaty. we receive all of California, Arizona, New \nMexico, etc... as well as Texas joining the union before the war. This was all caused by a change in foreign policy \nfrom Isolationism to that of a country at war.  \n    Another Historical Event which lead to the United States gaining more territory was with the purchase of Alaska, \nwhich was not stated in the constitution, and was also used by Thomas Jefferson in Louisiana. The United States acquired Alaska from Russia for 10 -50 million dollars. This Purchase went against the ideals sent by the united \nstates years prior with that by which not purchasing any more land.  \n    One Final Historical Event which was caused by a change in foreign policy from Isolationism to imperialism. The \nSpanish -American war was caused from the USA moving from a isolationist movement to that of an imperialist \ncountry, we declared war on Spain for the sinking of the U.S.S. Maine (\"Remember the Maine\"). This war lead to \nthe US \"acquiring\" the Philippines."

This had the effect of producing the first red scare in the United States, where xenophobia and fear of \ncommunist infiltration were extremely high. After this died down, in between the years of world war one and world war two, the united states entered a period of isolationism and were  not involved in foreign conflicts. However, the \nattack on pearl harbor by Japan made the united states enter the war directly. Even  when the USSR and United \nStates were on the same side, tensions were still high between the two countries because of opposing ideologies. The Soviet union and the United states emerged from World War II as the global superpowers, and with the United states \nseeing itself as the global protector of democracy, it would conflict with the soviet union."

Following world war two, the cold war started \nbetween the united states and the soviet u nion, or rather capitalism and communism. The first big major change in \nforeign policy was the fact that the United States joined their first peace -time military alliance ever with NATO. \nThey had never done this before, but fear of a soviet offensive caused them to join it and to support eastern Europe \nfrom communism, which can also be seen through the Marshall plan. Ever since Washingtons farewell adress, the U.S had never joined a foreign organization outside in the middle of a war, and this is seen durin g the first worl\nd\nw\nar where congress denied joining the league of nations because it would tie them to foreign affairs. So with them\njoining NATO, we can see just how much national security concerns contributed to changes in foreign policiy. Notonly that,  we see the United States involve themself in proxy wars around the world against communism. We see\nthis with the korean war and vietnam war. With the vietnam war, the United States kept spending and spending t\no\ns\nupport the south against the north, and kept promising the people at home that we were close to victory. However,\nthis was the first major war that was put on television, so the people at home saw that in reality, the united states\nwere not winning and could better be described as losing the war. Point being, national security concerns led to\nproxy wars in Asia and around the world because the U.S came up with the domino effect, saying that if they let onecountry in Asia become communist, the rest would soon fall to it, producing a domino effect which would\neventually reach the united states."

Before the ambush, the U.S. had supplied money and weapons to European countries fighting in the war. \nTheir foreign policy remained neutral and no sides were officially taken as the shipments were available to any country willing get it. However, the axis powers believed that the U.S. was clearly favoring the allies which resulted \nin their initial attack. Following the attack, the U.S. had completely changed its forign policy and changed focus to \nwin the war and help the allies. Rather then building the economy, they built a military and thousands of men and \nwomen were sent to help in Europe. Throughout the war the United States thrived and risked little to no dangers on \nthe nation itself as it was across the entire ocean. Nonetheless, the risk of communism cro ssing the atlantic if the \naxis powers had won was enough to keep fighting. Following the war, the United States took control of recovery \nprocess. They provided aid to all countries involved and established the Marshall Plan in order to prevent future \nwars and rebuild Europe. During this period the United States, had to adapt a new foreign policy multiple times to \nfight in a war and help recovery from it.  \nFurthermore, the United States and Soviet Union entered a stand -off which arguably could have begun the next \nworld war. Shortly after the WW2, the Soviet Union and U.S. threatened a nuclear war on each other. Although, it just remained threats and lies, the danger was there. Throughout the cold war, espionage and scandals flooded the \ngovernment and people be gan to have little trust in each other. The U.S. military built bases in neighboring countries \nto the U.S.S.R and remained as informed as possible. Foreign Policy was built around obtaining information and not \nstarting the war, but only reacting."

This supports Cohen's argument\nbecause the opportunities of reform out of the Depression was available in various New Deal programs such as thePWA and the TVA and so the people beniffitting from this, including minorities, would be more inclined to vote\nDemocratic because of these programs, which is what Cohen is saying.\nc) One development in the period 1932 -1945 that can be used to support Katznelson's perspective is the continued\nprominance of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation in the South."

        "chunk_text": "The New Deal efforts turned a \"blind eye\" to\nracial segregation and this allowed Jim Crow laws to stay in effect in the south, which is what Katznelson is arguing\nwhen she says that the New Deal collaborated with the South's racial hegemony.\nPage 1 of 1\n1A\nA. Cohen's interpretation of the New Deal is that the New Deal was beneficial to minorities, while Katznelson's\ninterpretation is that the New Deal was more beneficial to white supremacists. E vidence of Cohen's beliefs can be\nseen in how she details how minorities benefited from welfare programs created by the New Deal and how that led\nthem to support the policies by voting for FDR. Katznelson's interpretation can be seen in how he details how the\nNew Deal actually benefited white supremacists due to it not taking action against racist policies in the South.\nB. An event from 1932 -1945 that supports Cohen's argument is FDR's alphabet agencies. Those agencies created\njobs that minorities were in n eed of and helped them earn wages which was beneficial to them.\nC. An event from 1932 -1945 that supports Katznelson's interpretation is Jim Crow laws. The New Deal failed to\naddress Jim Crow laws that inhibited the rights of minorities as it mostly affecte d economic policy. By not\nad\ndressing Jim Crow laws the New Deal supported them and their ideals.\nPage 1 of 1\n1B\nA. Cohen's argument states that the New Deal applies to all no matter their race nor color of skin. He felt the New\nDeal is helping people of all races in Chi gaco while also helping immigrants. This differs from Katznelson's\ninterpretation which is that the New Deal benefited more to southern white supremacists and that the New Deal\ncontributed to the south's racism.\nB. Cohen's argument could be supported by the fact the people of all color were allowed to join and participate inthe military to help fight world war II and protect our country from the axis forces."

One way that agriculture influenced societal debates was through the need of labor. After slavery was abolishe d\ni\nn the Civil War, the South no longer had a reliable labor source in order to keep their agricultural economy,\neffectively threatening further collapse even after the war. This shows how agriculture influenced societal debates,\nas it made the south question how they should replace slavery as a labor source in order to keep their agricultural\neconomy.\nB\n. One way in how agriculture helped develop two regions in the United States was the settlement of the West and\nthe growth of the New South through industrial means. Once Reconstruction was over, technological developmentssuch as interchangeable parts allowed farmers to more efficiently farm in the West to dominate the smaller farmersand allow the mass production of farming goods , while industrial centers such as factories in the South helped the\nconversion of cotton into textiles, which soon overshadowed the North in terms of textile production."

One difference in how agriculture influenced the development of regions in the United States was the Midwest\nand North. While the Midwest was a center of agriculture where farmers could thrive given the right technologicaltools and the will to dominate much smaller farmers, the North was much less affected by the agriculture in theWest, and therefore focused more on expanding their  urban centers for immigrants to live in while shipping in foo\nd\nf\narmed in the West in railroads to minimally feed them. This shows how while agriculture helped the West generate\nmore business, agriculture in the North was less direct and was therefore only  able to contribute to minimally\nfeeding the influx of immigrants looking for economic opportunity and escaping religious persecution fromSouthern and Eastern Europe.\nPage 1 of 1\n4A\na. Sharecropping influenced societal debates shortly after the civil war, because havin g recently been freed, formerly\nenslaved people had little skill other than farming practice, and society was placed with a debate on how to integrate\nfreed people into society. One of the ways that the South tackled this debate was the institution of the controversial\nSharecropping system, that wasn't very different from slavery to begin with.\nb. A similarity between the South region and the Great Plains region was that agriculture practices had been opene d\nup\n to formerly enslaved people, as their citizenship and property owning rights had just been guaranteed by the 14th\nand 15th amendments. Both in the west and in the south, wealthy and opurtunistic black people worked towards\nbeing able to own farms through a farmhand system in states like Kansas and Oklahoma in the Great Plains, and\nAlabama and Mississippi in the South.\nc."

The Government has entered upon the great work of educating and citizenizing the Indians and establishing them upon homesteads. The adults are expected to assume the role of citizens, and of course the rising generation will be expected and required more nearly to fill the measure of citizenship, and the main purpose of educating them is to enable them to read, write, and speak the English language. . . . Only through the medium of the English tongue can they acquire a knowledge of the Constitution of the country and their rights and duties thereunder. \n. . . Deeming it for the very best interest of the Indian, both as an individual and as an embryo citizen, to have \nthis policy strictly enforced among the various schools on Indian reservations, orders have been issued accordingly to Indian agents. . . . \n. . . The first step to be taken toward civilization, toward teaching the Indians the mischief and folly of \ncontinuing their barbarous practices, is to teach them the English language. \nDocument 3 \nSource: United States Supreme Court ruling in United States v.

Indeed, it is doubtful if Congress would ever assent to the annexation of territory upon the condition that its inhabitants, however foreign they may be to our habits, traditions, and modes of life, shall become at once citizens of the United States.

In all these cases there is an implied denial of the right of the inhabitants to American citizenship until Congress by further action shall signify its assent thereto. . . . \nIt is obvious that in the annexation of outlying and distant possessions, grave questions will arise from \ndifferences of race, habits, laws, and customs of the people, and from differences of soil, climate, and production which may require action on the part of Congress that would be quite unnecessary in the annexation of contiguous territory inhabited only by people of the same race, or by scattered bodies of native Indians. \nDocument 5 \nSource: W.

Additionally, the \nresponse explains the historical situation of Document 3 of attempts to maintain the balance of slave \nand free states. The response accurately explains the audience of Document 4 as southerners \nsympathetic to slavery who sought biblical justification for the institution. As well, the response \nexplains the point of view of Document 6 as that of an abolitionist minister using biblical justification \nto condemn the institution of slavery.  \nDemonstrating Complex Understanding  \nThe response earned 1 point for demonstrating a complex understanding because it effectively \nexplains how the point of view, purpose, historical situation, and/or audience of four of the \ndocuments supports an argument that responds to the prompt. The response also explains relevant \nand insightful connections across time periods when it draws a comparison between the treatment of enslaved people in the United States to the treatment of Native Americans under early Spanish colonists."

It shows that in Document 2,  \nPalmer\u2019s perspective as a government official encouraged labeling Americans on the political left as foreign  \nand un-American. For Document 3, it shows that Grant\u2019s purpose in promoting immigration restriction was  \ninfluenced by ideas about racial difference.

[ situation ] \n \n    \n    \n \n    Page 1 of 2 1A\nPrior to 1917, American society had undergone many rapid changes. The end of slavery and the \nratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments marked a significant sociocultural and political \nchange in America, as Black Americans were able to experience freedom and mobility for the first \ntime in around a century. With the success of abolition came a growth in the fervor of other reform movements, such as prohibition and the women's suffrage movement; both of these movements were able to gain much attention and eventually had their own amendments ratified to the sontitutuon that \nguaranteed female suffrage and the prohibition of alcohol. Additionally, the development of industries led to the Gilded Age, a period of generally increased prosperity for Americans. However, while America was developing domestically, Europe was facing crises which culminated in the First World War (WWI) following the assassination of Austro-Hungarian Archduke Franz Ferdinand. \nThough the United States initially maintained neutrality, it eventually entered WWI, which ended not long after. Around the same time was the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, where the longstanding tsar Nicolas II was overthrown and replaced by a communist regime. Following the war, there were many widespread beliefs about threats to the United States, which was significant in shaping society \nfrom 1917 to 1945 by leading to increased isolationism, opposition to communism, and fear of and disregard for immigrants. \nBefore WWI, the United States had historically maintained isolationist policies when it came to \nEuropean affairs."

        "chunk_text": "In his famed Neutrality Proclamation, President George Washington highlighted \nthe importance of isolation and neutrality from European conflicts. The United States govenrment had generally followed this advice, although the American empire did expand in the late 1800s and early 1900s with the annexation of Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines. Yet following WWI, America largely returned to its isolationist ideals. This is evidenced by Congress's refusal to \nratify the Treaty of Versailles to end WWI with a stipulation for the League of Nations, which was an international organization proposed by President Woodrow Wilson that would emphasize diplomacy and negotiation over war. Congressional beliefs regarding the League of Nations are made evident in a speech given by Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, which highlights the US \ngovernment's opposition to involvement in international conflict (Doc. 1). Instead, the US government advocated for isolationism to ensure its own wellbeing, which would subsequently ensure it was strong enough to guarantee world peace. This document, written from the perspective \nof an employee of a government which had just lost lives and resources in a foreign war not of its great concern, supports the notion that threats to the U.S.'s own wellbeing if it involved itself in more international conflict shaped the nation's isolationist society and government. However, the opposite perspective is shown at the start of the Second World War (WWII), as many Americans supported \nneutrality initially as they believed they were not threatened by European fascism. A 1939 political cartoon depicts three U.S. Senators hiding behind a literal wall of neutrality (Doc. 5)."

Following the end of WWI \nand the successful Bolshevik Revolution came a Red Scare in the United States, where many feared \na Communist takeover of the government that posed a threat to the democracy America had only recently fought to protect. An article written from the perspective of Attorney General A. Mitchell \nPalmer, who staunchly opposed communism, described the fear of Americans regarding the spread \nof communism and the response of the Justice Department, which swore it would find and detain \nany Communist within U.S. borders (Doc. 2). This document describes the beliefs many citizens had \nabout the intense threat to American democracy posed by communism and supports the notion that \nsuch beliefs were shaping both American society and the responses of the federal government. \n    A final prominent belief about a perceived threat to the United States was the threat that \nimmigrants posed to the wellbeing of White, Protestant, Anglo-Saxon American society, which led to \nmany societal prejudices against such grops. A 1924 article written in the historical context of a rise \nin immigration following the end of WWI described how immigration rose as a result of American \nprosperity and argued that such a rise would harm the native population and reduce its standard of \nliving (Doc. 3)."

Such prejudices grew with \nthe advent of WWII and American involvement in the war. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor came an executive order requring the forced relocation of Japanese-Americans and Japanese immigrants to internment camps due to the military threat of espionage and sabotage. A memoir written in the historical context of Japanese internment and from the point of view of Sachi Kajiwara, \na Japanese American woman, recalled events at one of these internment camps, describing the location as being surrounded by barbed wire and police (Doc. 6).

Russia, for exmaple, \nhad the most casualiteis of any country during the war, but after the second world war, they became one of the two most powerful countries in the world: America and themselves. Although America had a strong military and was a domininant global power, many American citizens were still fearful of \nforeign threats, which led to many fears like that of communism, atomic attack, and many others. Americans lived with a fear in the back of their minds that was present everyday, this was the fear of an attack from Russia or another outisde force. Even during the war, Americans were fearful of their own neighbors."

        "chunk_text": "Japanse Americans were thought to be spies for Japan and plotting against the US. \nNot in as a high a degree, but the same goes for German and Italian American. During times of great threats to the nation, Americans are very fearful of their adversaries, and are constantly suspicious and on alert. \nIn document 2, the author mentions that the DOJ will \"pursue the attack of the \"reds\"\". The \nReds in this instance are communists living in America during the 1920's who have come from Russia. He also says that these Reds are trying to ovethrow order and lawfulness in this country. Just from these few words, already we have a sense that Americans are very suspicious and paranoid when threrat levels are high, and their day to day lives are lived in paranoia. A growing \nhatred for these Reds was also a major theme during this time. Large masses of people sometimes could be seen in the streets demanding that all Reds be arrested or killed. Overall, the majority of Americans had a growing hatred and fear of Reds, because they beleived they were everywhere, spying on their every move. \nDocument 3 explicitly says that immigration should be more restricted, and that the influx of \nimmigrants is going to decrease the living standard, and that the country will become poorer and less sophisticated overtime. However, this points at something larger that continues to be in American society to this day. Americans remain fearful of immigrants because they believe that \nsome of them are spies and have malintent when they come to the US. Especially during a time of high threat, like ww1 or ww2 as mentioned earlier, Americans are much more fearful and paranoid, \nso naturally, they would not want more foreigners who come from the belligernet nations to enter the \nUS. Document 3 hints at the existing and underlying fear of new people coming from foreign lands. \nThe very fear that Amercians have has led them to fear immigrants, which is what all Amercians are in the first place."

        "chunk_text": "Furthermore, document 5 depicts three US senators who can be seen hiding behind a wall of \nsandbags, protected from the distant explosions that can be seen coming from Europe. This can be attributed to \"isolationism\", which is what Amercia stood by during both world wars, that is before they entered both of them. Americans feared the massive conflicts that were occurring in Europe during ww1 and 2, which is why they tried to stay out of them as long as possible. Americans \nwanted no part of national conflict, because that same fear of getting entangled into a mssive conflict was everpresent in their minds. Once again, this just goes to show how fear of getting involved contributed to the growing support of isolationsim. \nAlso,  document 6 sheds some light on what is what like living in a Japanese interment camp. \nBut, what needs to be extracted and learned from this document is that Americans were so fearful and paranoid of Japanese people during ww2, that innocent civilians who wer hard working American patriots were rounded up and contained in designated spaces, so that they did not pose any threat to anyone else. It just goes to show further the true level of Paranoia that was in everyones \nminds at the time was at an all time high, and day to day life was changing due to this fear.  Just like \nAmericans were fearful of the Japanese during ww2, they were fearful of an atomic attack during the \ncold war. Americans were tought what safety measures to take if a bomb was to ever be dropped on \nthem, even young children knew what to do. \"Bert the Turtle\" was an ad campaign made by the \ngovernment to demonstatre to children esspecially what to do if a bomb was ever dropped. \nHomeowners even made thier own bomb shelters in the backyards out of fear of a bomb being dropped. It goes to show that even on TV, Americans were reminded of their fears everyday, and life became a game of survival and being aware of your surroundings at all times."

The documents two, five, six, and seven provide evidence that supports \nthe claim that foreign threats affected the US society to a large extent because they all changed the \nway that society was run. \nStarting in document two the historical context of document two is the First Red Scare. The First \nRed Scare was the fear of Americans that the Soviet Union's communist influence would break into \nAmerican land. The fear of this communism led to a lack in trust in the government in America. Following the second World War was the emrgance of the Second Red Scare which soon turned into the Cold War. The second red scare was still the fear of communism and now also the fear of the \nspread of communism throughout Europe and Asia. This also soon sparked the Vietnam war under the Domino theory, which was to strive for containment of communism. The constant fear of communism amoung Americans resulted in effects on society as people were being accused and condemned for being supposed communists. \nIn document five the purpose of the image is to promote neutrality. The United States declared neutrality from the second World War until later in the war. The idea of nuetrality also shaped \nAmerican society during the time period because it prevented American men from being forced to go \nfight in the war. \nThe historical context of document six was the Japenese internment in the US during WW2. During \nworld war two the US was nuetral, despite having helped its previous allies Britian through the Lend \nLease act, it was technically nuetral. Once the Japanese attack an American naval at Pearl Harbor, \nthe US retracted it's nuetrality and declared war on Japan. After this had happened there were concerns about Japenese-Americans living in the US and the government forcefully put Japanese-Americans into internment camps."

From the French and Indian War to the \nAmerican Revolution, there was a continual push to expand and take control of the \"God given \nrights\" that were outlined by John Locke. Settler expansion had a large influence on North America by reshaping American identity, establishing new conflicts with foreign nations, and establishing a new notion of the expectations for a free America.  \nAmerican identity had witness a transformation from settler expansion during the period 1754 to 1800. During the French and Indian War settlers british citizens had fought against French and \nIndian powers over the Ohio River Valley territory. As the war continued Americans had continued \nto be a large aspect of those who participated in the war effort, leading them to believe they should \nenjoy the fruits of their labor when the Treaty of Ghent was signed as the French and Indian War came to a closing. However, instead of the dreams of western expansion, Britian establishment the Proclomation line of 1763, forbidding Americans from expanding west of the Appalachin mountains. \nBy expanding settlers out west, North America had witnessed it first wave of western expansion. This wave would be a continuous theme of American identity throughout American history. American expansion had lead to the belief of Manifest Destiny and even government involvement in persuading settlers to move out west through policies like the Homestead Act and Pacific Railroad \nAct. These Acts had given governmental subsidies to companies or citizens to inspire them to populate the west."

        "chunk_text": "However, acts found later in period were only possible because of the influence that settler expansion in 1763 had laid the foundation for.  \nAs a result of settler expansion from the first wave at the conclusion of the French and Indian Wars, Amer ica had witnessed a continous trend of conflict with Natives. The Pontaic rebellion, was one of \nthe very first rebellions with Natives and set a standard for how the rest of the period would continue. The rebellion was ultimately crushed by American forces, however, that does not distract \nfrom its violent nature that led to the death of hundreds of Americans and Nativess. Natives were then intiially regarded as an indepdent nation that settlers should leave alone, however, this notion was not held by settlers. Following the end of the American Revolution, in which America won and \nacquired even more territory towards the Mississippi river, settlers had continued to expand out westward. North America was no longer a conglomerate of different nations laying claim to one big land mass but a united power that Americans held the majority of jurisdiction over. Spain had given America the territorial rights over Florida, and in 1803 America would gain an even greater amount \nof mass with the Lousiana Purchase.  \nWith such a surge in newly acquired land, North America and the policies of American government had to transform alongside the increased grasp of settlers. Settlers could now move as far out west \nas they deemed possible now that British government had no influence over American society following the end of the American revolution. In response to this expansion of territory and soverereignty two political sides of American society were established: the federalist and the anti-\nfederalist. The Articles of Confederation was the first major attempt by American government to see \nthe way at which American government would be maintained."

As a result of this rebellions like shay's rebellion were able to persist and Boston had no government to reply upon. Howevever, after the formation of the Constitution which \nfavored federalist, the constitution recognized the importance of a strong federal government and was able to easily put down the Whiskey Rebellion. Since settler expansion had continued through Page 1 of 2\nthe century, new forms of government had to continue alongside the wave of the freedom that was \nnewly acquired. After books like Thomas Paine's Common sense that called for revolution, \nindependence had seemed to be the only answer. However, with this new acquired independence \nthere had to be a greater push towards regulation and determining the role of the federal government. This theme of determination alongside expansion was not a sole characterisitc of America from 1754 to 1800 but a continous driving force in foreign policies like after the war of 1812 \nand even the American civil war.  Page \n2 of 2 2A\n    2B\nThroughout the late 15th and 16th centuries, European powers had the desire to explore land \nelsewhere. Spain wanted to grow their religion and spread Catholicism to the new world, while \nFrench and Dutch desired a more trade-based approach. Similarly, people from Englad wanted to \nescape religious persecution and colonize elsewhere. The start of this exploration led to the \ndevelopment of North America into becoming a major global power. English settler expansion between 1754-1800 influenced North America to a large extent by promoting the establishment of its \nindependence and creating political reform from previous governmental systems. \n    To start off, new ideas of independence had formed in North America that stemmed from English \nsettlers expanding and colonizing the region during 1754-1800."

The Intolerable Acts became so bad that American colonists grew tired of maintaining loyalty to England \nand staged the Boston Tea Party, where colonists threw imports of tea into the Boston Harbor to express their hatred. This represents a major change because for so long, the American colonists had remained loyal to England, despite the religious persecution and other factors that they faced there. One man, Thomas Paine, decided he wanted change, and distributed out the pamphlet \nCommon Sense, which inspired many to join the revolt in fighting against the British. He wrote about why such a little island on the other side of the world should have so much power on the colonies. This caused many American's to experience even more dissent, and when the colonists sent over the Olive Branch petition as a last resort, and that didn't work, they declared the start of \nthe Revolutionary War. This left a lasting effect on American society because from then on, America realized the importance of independence and how it needed to continue being maintained in order for settlers to prosper. \n    To continue, political reform in North America was a major effect of English settler expansion in \nbetween 1754-1800. The nation drafted the Articles of Confederation which was the first \ngovernmental document that attempted to encompass the new guidlines of how North America was \ngoing to be run. However, it proved its limitations when the nation realized it had no power to \nregulate commerce or call for a national army."

        "chunk_text": "Governmental officials knew they needed to make \nchange, so they called for a Constitutional Convention to draft the United States Constitution. Some groups were against this document, as it granted more power to the central, federal government. These people were known as Anti-Federalists. However, they agreed upon the inclusion of a Bill of \nRights to protect the citizens individual liberties. The Constitution is still in use today, and acts as a guidline over how the United States is governed. As well as this, the colonists wanted to make sure the government didn't end up being as controlling as the English government. They made sure that the Constitution established a system of checks and balances to gurantee that one branch of \ngovernment didn't have excessive power. They also established a bicameral legislature made up of the House of Representatives and Senate. This helped to ensure more equality in decisions. Both of these political reforms are important to consider because without them, the United States could have become an extremely tyrannical powerhouse.  \n    All in all, English settler expansion between 1754-1800 influenced North America to a large extent by causing a call for independence and enacting political reform. Without colonists sprouting a drive for independence, America would have remained under British rule, never allowing it to become a self-governing country. As well as this, if they hadn't advocated for fairness and equality, the settlers \nwould have migrated for nothing, and possibly still be under the oppressive rule of England - even today. Page 1 of 1\n2C\nDuring the mid 18th century to the 19th century settler expansion influenced North America because \nEuropean countries such as Spain, French and Britain wanted to conquer land in North America so \nthat their people would have more land. These countries had differnet methods when they wanted to conquer North America."

Settler expansion led to change in government structure and hunting methods in North America. \nIn 1754 to 1800 settlers changed the governemt str ucture of North America when the Natives didn't \ngive up their land. Spain wanted the Native americans to give their land up but when the Native \nAmericans didn't give it up they decided to take it by force by enslaving the Native americans. When \nBritain wanted to take over land they wanted the Native Americans to be under their rule which happened and the native americans hated it. These two countries caused the natives to undestand what it was like to be under the control of another government which for the Britsih was a united \ngovernment. \nSettlers also changed their hunting methods in North America during 1754 to 1800 when they introduced animals from their countries such as horses. Before the horses the Natives would do all \ntheir hunting on foot but now that they had horses it made it easier for them to catch up to their food \nsource when they ran away. This made it easier for natives to kill the wolly mamaths which provided \nthey a food source aswell as fur to keep them war during the winter. The introduction to the horses made it easier for the natives to obtain fur and then trade it with the French so that there cound be peace between them.

However, these expeditions and endeavors were not solitary events; \ntheir occurance allowed for tens of millions of Americans and immigrants to follow in their footsteps west and irreversably change the course of the western United States. Migration was the greatest influence on the western United States from 1820 to the beginning of the Spanish-American War, as it directly led to an increasing spirit of imperialism and Manifest Destiny, the construction of \ninfrastructure projects such as the Transcontinental Railroad, and increased conflict with Native American groups.   \nAs more and more Americans began to migrate westward via routes such as the Oregon Trail and the Sante Fe Trail, the concept of Manifest Destiny grew significantly, fostered the early signs of \nimperialist ambition, and most importantly introduced millions of Americans into the west who would go on to populate places like California. Beginning in the 1840s, Americans east of the Mississippi River were continously drawn by the promise of land and liberty afforded by the west, and an escape from the now crowded urban areas of the east coast. Additionally, events like the \nCalifornia Gold Rush in 1849 and the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 1890s drew millions seeking riches and fame. Thus, it was the migration itself that massively grew the population of the American West and led to the prominence of states like California today. The very demographics of the United States and the density of our urban population centers today is largely owed to the inital \nmigration of millions during the 1800s."

Indeed, it can be argued that the imperialist endeavors pursued by the United States in the form of claiming Cuba, \nPuerto Rico, and the Philippines during the Spanish-American War were a direct result of the general mood of Manifest Destiny pioneered in the American West in the decades prior.  \nAnother important impact of the migration of millions of Americans westward was the building of \nthe Transcontinental Railroad and other infrastructure projects that helped the United States \nconnect, communicate, and grow economically. The Transcontinental Railroad began under the administration of Abraham Lincoln, who was one of many to realize the need to link the eastern United States with the relatively new and growing state of California, and allowed for the rapid \ntransportation of people and goods between both coasts. This construction even had the unintended effect of attracting many migrants, largely from China, into the American west to build the tracks, roads, and telegraph lines needed to continue expanding into the West. Without westward migration, these infrastructure projects may have never been realized, as the need for rapid communication and \ntransporation with a large segment of the American population would not have existed. Furthermore, it was these very infrastructure projects that allowed for massive industrialization across the United States and boosted the American economy massively during the Gilded Age.  \nThe most significant development brought about by westward migration was that of increased \nconflict with Native American groups across the west. As millions traveled westward to claim land \noffered under Abraham Lincoln, white and immigrant settlers came into increasing contact with \nnative tribes on the Plains and elsewhere."

These developments in Page 1 of 2\nthe American West would not have been occurred without the mass migration of tens of millions of \nsettlers to the west, as the competition for the land would have never occurred. Furthermore, the \ncontinuing effects of the reservation system and the oppression of Native Americans is reflected by \nevents like the occupation of Alcatraz Island and the continuing controversiality of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \nIn conclusion, westward migration had a significant effect on the American West. The migration of \ntens of millions westward was the impetus for the founding of numerous states, and saw the early \nseeds of imperialism be sewn through the concept of Manifest Destiny. Furthermore, the migration of many to California after the Gold Rush in 1849 led to an increased infrastructure system via the Transcontinental Railroad and significant telrgaph operations. Finally, the conflict of settlers with \nNative American groups led to the implementation of the reservation system, the Trail of Tears, and countless battles in the West. Without the settlement and migration of so many individuals in the American West, the United States would be very different today, and the development of the nation into a global superpower would have lagged behind tremendously.

Things such as The Lousiana \nPurchase, the Northwest Ordinance, and the Mexican-American war helped to complete this. All of \nthese events led to the gaining of territory across the continent.

This later led to revolts from farmers and the formation of the Populist party which advocated for the use of paper money and direct election of senators. \n   Eventually, this led to a questioning of the Laissez-Faire economic system and encouraged the \ngoverment to work to break up trusts and monopolies.

One of thses changes was settlement houses by Jane Adams who wanted to help these people and in the settlement houses people were educated n many differnet things.

Wartime production levels combined with high American spirit paved the war \nfor Americans to move across towns, cities, and states for work and leisure reasons. Also, many \nAmericans of color chose to leave certain areas in order to escape prejudiced legislation and economic hardship in search for new opportunity. Although the migration of African-Americans to the north and workers to the sunbelt had an effect on American society, suburbanization had a much \ngreater effect. \nAs a way to escape the Jim Crow South, many African-Americans chose to leave in order to find more opportunity and racial equality. Many black Americans moved to Chicago, Detroit, and New \nYork City as a result of this."

Also, many people chose to move to the sunbelt, encompassing the southern half of the United States. This resulted from the development of the military industrial complex and its presence in sunbelt states, in which defense contractors were able to gain government contracts by giving \nfunding to politicians, as Eisenhower warned. Many defense companies such as Lockheed Martin and Northrup Gruman were based in the sunbelt, drawing many new workers for economic opportunity. The result of this was increased political power of states such as California and Texas because of a massive population increase, which broke the contintuity of concentrated voting power \nin the north. These two developments did have an affect on influencing society, however suburbanization had a larger effect. \nStarting in the 1920's and truly rising to power, suburbs quickly became the main source of influence on American society. For example, Levittowns, which were planned out communities of affordable \nhomes in Long Island, were catalysts in driving this change. It led to the further development of suburbs across this country, as it became simple to master plan \"cookie cutter\" communities for economic gain. In addition, this new suburbanization led to an increase in the use of the automobile. This newfound urban sprawl meant that citizen's jobs and sites for leisure were not accessible in \nmany cases by public transportation or by foot, which increased people's reliance on cars, eventually becoming a staple of the American household. Moreover, suburban areas typically helped spread mass media, influencing culture."

Finally, suburbs were a place in which other forms of culture were developed. Since many homes were simliar to each other, it drove a sense of social conformity into the American public. Many homes were outfitted with \nsimilar materials and interior items, men wore clothing that aligned with popular trends, and women had to create social groups because they were oftentimes confined to domestic duties. All of these factors had a large impact on American culture.

One example of how this influenced society was families \nmoving into more suburban life. This is because it changed lifestyle of many Americans to families with housewifes and working husband in the American dream lifestyle. Another way that this \nmigration influenced society was because of the change in working class.

Because technology was \nvastly becoming advanced, air conditioning was the new popular mechanism during the mid to late \n20th century. Because of air conditioning and other technological advancments, it allowed poeple to comfortably live in warm climates. This influenced migration because it allowed many people to move to more southern states where the equator is closer. It was also a major change because air conditioning was a new source of technology that no one ever had before, but it became more \ncommon in households over time.  \n    Another advancment that contributed to the migration of the US was the creation of suburbs and \nrural houses.

The first excerpt by Keith Melder argues that \nwomen, due to religious movements and frustration with the limitations placed on them, came \ntogether to establish and support the woman\u2019s right movement. The second excerpt by Gerta Lerner argues that due to industrialization there was a significant difference between middle-class and lower-class women\u2019s activism. These differences led to middle-class women \nfocusing on women\u2019s rights reform activism while lower-class women focused on activism for economic advancement."

Bceause of the mass concumption that resulted from the Gilded \nAge the American economy was fragile and collapsed in the late 1920s.

The most frequent historical developments to address were the debates about the ideals and identity of the United States in relation to slavery, the growing regional division between the North and the South, \nand the moral debates surrounding the question of slavery. \n \n\u2022 This  question primarily focused on causation, contextualization, analyzing primary sources, and \nargument development. \n\u2022 This question primarily addressed Topics 3.6, 3.11, 4.3, and 4.11 through 4.13. \nHow well did the responses address the course content related to this question? How well did the responses integrate the skill(s) required on this question? \n\u2022 Many responses successfully wrote a historically defensible thesis that identified the ways in which \nUnited States society was shaped by the institution of slavery. Most responses tended to focus on \nthe influence of slavery on morality and religion, ideological principles, and economics. More \nsimplistic theses tended to focus on the geographic and/or political division of the country brought about by slavery. \n \n\u2022 Most  responses successfully provided contextualization."

This may be done in a variety of ways, such as: \n\u2022Explaining multiple themes or perspectives to explore complexity ornuance; OR\n\u2022Explaining multiple causes or effects, multiple similarities ordifferences, or multiple continuities or changes; OR\n\u2022Explaining both cause and effect, both similarity and difference, orboth continuity and change; OR\n\u2022Explaining relevant and insightful connections within and acrossperiods or geographical areas. These connections should clearlyrelate to an argument that responds to the prompt.\nMay demonstrate a complex understanding through effective use of \nevidence relevant to an argument that addresses the prompt."
